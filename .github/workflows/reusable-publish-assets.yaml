# Used to publish release assets uploaded by a previous job (e.g.`reusable-build-runtime-flavor.yaml)`
# Example
# jobs:
#   build-job:
#     ...
#     steps:
#       - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
#         with:
#           name: php.zip
#           ...
#   publish:
#     uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-publish-assets.yaml
#     needs: build-job
#     with:
#       target-name: "php"

# Note: This workflow should be refactored into a custom GH action.
# This will allow us to call it in job steps and have more flexibility.
